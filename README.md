# FunctionalJava

Just a toy piece of code to see if it is possible to represent arbitrary functions and pass them around as values in Java.
The types of these functions are nightmares... so it's probably not the most useful code.

Somewhat interesting is the use of nested pairs as type-safe n-tuples, though creating a tuple with many elements is pretty ugly.
